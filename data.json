If you have the contour shape facing forwards, you enjoy relief for forearms and wrists \u2013 and having it at the back creates a gap where you can lead all the cables down. The metal mesh at the back of the desk allows air through that cools your PC and is so sturdy that you can even clamp a pair of monitor arms to it. It\u2019s easy to keep the desk neat and tidy by using the cable management net under the table top. The height of the legs can be adjusted manually to 6 different heights from 68 to 78 cm, so that you can always sit at a comfortable height. The design of the high backrest gives your body, neck and head a sturdy and comfortable support. You can easily turn and adjust the height of the headrest to give your neck a nice support when playing \u2013 and when you want to relax between matches. The adjustable and lockable tilt function increases stability and control in different sitting positions. The armrests follow your movements and can be adjusted in height, which reduces strain on your arms and shoulders. The castors are rubber coated to run smoothly on any type of floor. The mesh material of the backrest lets air through, which is extra nice when a match drags on. The safety castors have a pressure-sensitive brake mechanism that keeps the chair in place when you stand up, and releases automatically when you sit down. The seat\u2019s leather-like upholstery is durable and easy to wipe clean. The synchronised seat and back tilt follows your body movements and adjusts the chair to the correct position.   ",

If you have the contour shape facing forwards, you enjoy relief for forearms and wrists \u2013 and having it at the back creates a gap where you can lead all the cables down. The height of the electric underframe can be adjusted from 72 to 120 cm, so you can always sit or stand at a comfortable height. It should be comfortable to play, especially when a match drags on. That\u2019s why the table top is deep \u2013 so you can position screens at a comfortable distance from your eyes. It\u2019s easy to keep the desk neat and tidy by using the cable management tray under the table top. The adjustable and lockable tilt function increases stability and control in different sitting positions. The armrests follow your movements and can be adjusted in height, which reduces strain on your arms and shoulders. The castors are rubber coated to run smoothly on any type of floor. The design of the high backrest gives your body, neck and head a sturdy and comfortable support. The mesh material of the backrest lets air through, which is extra nice when a match drags on. The safety castors have a pressure-sensitive brake mechanism that keeps the chair in place when you stand up, and releases automatically when you sit down. The seat\u2019s leather-like upholstery is durable and easy to wipe clean. The synchronised seat and back tilt follows your body movements and adjusts the chair to the correct position. You can easily turn and adjust the height of the headrest to give your neck a nice support when playing \u2013 and when you want to relax between matches. ",

You can choose a larger TV if it\u2019s not heavier than the specified max load for the bench\u2019s top.\nThe top panel of the TV bench is intended for a TV with a maximum weight of 50 kg.\nThe push-open function requires a space between the frame and the drawer front to allow the drawer to be pushed to open. The small gap is necessary to allow this function and is not a product deviation.\nThe max load for a wall-hung cabinet depends on the wall material.\nDifferent wall materials require different types of fixing devices. Use fixing devices suitable for the walls in your home, sold separately.\nEKET suspension rails for wall mounting are included."
